	<h1>So Who Am I?</h1>
	<p class="tab">
		For those who don't know who I am, pretty much anyone who is reading this page, my name is Houa Cha. Phonetically Who-Ah Cha for my non-Hmong speaking folks. Who am I? No one really just your average guy trying to live the best life he can. I enjoy life's simple pleasures: food, learning, video games and people. Pretty lack-luster right? I mean I can come up with some fantastic origin story of my being, which if I were to be honest would be much more fun, but I see no point in lying about that. I mean I could say that my extince is due to the fact that my father was able to get both my mother and him out a war-torn country while avoiding being hunted by the people in which they shared a country, but then that wouldn't be my story. My story is that of a boy was born to a family that was already 7 kids deep who were already struggling to meet the basic need for life. Honestly, poor planning on my parents part but you really can't blame them. They were use to a life of farming and communal subsistence after all, the exact opposite of America. Growing up in a large family while being poor gives you a lot of perspective on life early-on. You get to experience damn near everything from gang members scouting your home all the way to your first experiences with armed robbery. Even though I was way too young to be personnaly affect, those events for sure shaped my life.

		Maybe these aren't the kind of things you would like to know about me; too story-like. Alright then, here are some mundane things about me. I love to experience food, which pretty much means I eat to enjoy food. I am an otaku I guess or weeb depending on your prefered term. I don't care for watching sports but enjoy playing them. I play a fair share of video games. Lastly, I'm the kind of person who will always play devils advocate.
